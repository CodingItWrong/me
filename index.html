<h2><a name="this-site">This Site</p></h2>

<p>The idea for this web site started because I couldn’t figure out how to summarize myself. My previous web site and my social network "about" texts were centered around the way I was presenting myself professionally as a technologist—but those things shift over time. And I’m kind of at the point in my life where I defy easy summarization, even to myself.</p>

<p>For some reason it occurred to me "what if I just started writing things on a web page?" It occurred to me that I could link between sections of the page to link back and forth between related things.</p>

<p>A few interesting things fall out of this. Since I don’t know yet how I want to present the info, I can just add the content now and style it later. This is a chance to learn some more advanced CSS that allow me to change the presentation significantly without needing to change the markup. Since the markup will be easy to edit directly, and since it will be one page without the need for repeated headers, there isn’t a need to write in Markdown. And this content-first approach means the page should work well on low-power devices and even the vintage computers I collect.</p>

<p>Since the coming of Bootstrap I’ve wanted to have a web site that looked different, but I never had a reason to make it look different. Now I do: it’s not structured like a typical web site. And since the early days of the web I’ve wanted to take advantage of hypermedia but haven’t usually had a reason to do so.</p>
